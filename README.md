## Scalablity (issue Facing with Scalablity vs Read Counts) and solution

1. user data / clan data might be full of all the past tournament data (Remove after 50)
2. also notifications that they did not want (More Than Month Ago) (Remove After 20)
3. old tournament data that are on ended section that remove from index (But Keep Document)(Remove After 25 from ended only)

> there is a neat solution about all of this problems stated above that what we can do is create sub collection and store all data there but if you are using this product extensively these problems arise after 1-2 years because there is no way you can do more than 50 tournament a year.
